#PART7:Analysis of Variance for Total Sales in Boston,Detroit and Atlanta Regions

#Read the data as data table and create a new data table for required regions.
dt<-as.data.table(read.csv("avocado.csv"))
new_dt<-dt[region=="Atlanta"|region=="Boston"|region=="Detroit"]

#1.Perform the diagnostic tests for the assumptions on ANOVA and test the following assumptions:

#(1)Normality of residuals,
hist(new_dt$Total.Volume)
#The distribution doesn't look normal but in hist always do not clear conclusions.
anova_one_way <- aov(Total.Volume~region, data = new_dt)
qqnorm(anova_one_way$residuals)
qqline(anova_one_way$residuals)
#Observations are incompatible with theoretical values so there is not a normality. 

#(2)The errors have a mean of 0, 

#(3)The errors are independent,
#Independency can only be achieved if you have set your experiment up correctly.
#There is no way to test the independency;

#(4)The errors have equal variance among each treatment levels.
leveneTest(Total.Volume~region, data = new_dt)
#p value = 2.2e-16 and p << 0.05 so there is not a homogeneity of variance.
#We can illustrate this difference with boxplot.

#One-way ANOVA is not a valid test to determine any significant difference between group means. Conclusion of ANOVA is not certain. 
#Because there are not homogeneity of variance and normality.

#2.State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
# H0: There is not a difference between the mean of total amount of avocado sold: in the following regions: Atlanta, Boston and Detroit. 
# H1: At least two of the means are not equal.

#3.Compute the test statistic.
anova_one_way <- aov(Total.Volume~region, data = new_dt)
summary(anova_one_way)

#4.Make the decision and interpret the result.
#p_value = 4.57e-07 and p << 0.05. Region is a significantly important factor for sell.
#Reject null hypothesis in favor of alternative hypothesis.
#At least two of the means are not equal.

#5.If the ANOVA is significant, conduct the Post-hoc tests.
TukeyHSD(anova_one_way)
#For Boston-Atlanta, p_value is 0.3724433 and more than 0.05 so there is not a regional sales difference between Bostan and Atlanta.
#But for Detroit-Boston and Detroit-Atlanta which p_values is smaller than 0.05,regional sales differences are important. 
#p_value=0.0003052 and p < 0.05 for Detroit-Atlanta.
#p_value=0.0000006 and p < 0.05 for Detroit-Boston.


#6.Plot the boxplot and interpret it.
boxplot(Total.Volume~region,data = new_dt)
#Boxplot is always a good idea  for understanding which groups have the significantly different variance.
#Atlanta and Bostan have a larger variance than Detroit's variance.
#Atlanta and Bostan have close variances.
